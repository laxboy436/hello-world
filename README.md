# hello-world
A little repository for a person who knows less next to nothing about code. Yeeeeeeeh
I like learning. I want to be a founder in the future, but that's in a couple of years. I'm trying to figure out what I want to do now. Many options. It's overwhelming but I like it. I took a gap year and I've learned a lot.
